# Theory of Programming Languages

An exploration of programming language history. Each language features an implementation of the Caesar cipher - encrypting, decrypting, and solving.

## Procedural languages include:
    - Fortran
    - COBOL
    - BASIC
    - Pascal
    - Scala (in a procedural manner)

## Functional languages include:

    - ML or F#
    - Erlang
    - JavaScript (in a functional manner - no loops)
    - Scala	(in a functional manner - no loops)
